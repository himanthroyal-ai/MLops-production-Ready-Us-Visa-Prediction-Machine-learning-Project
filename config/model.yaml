# Minimal example configuration for neuro_mf's ModelFactory
# Customize models, parameter grids and search settings as needed for your project.


# Notes:
# - Adjust modules, classes and param grids to match your desired estimators.
# - If neuro_mf expects different top-level keys, adapt accordingly. This
#   minimal file provides the dict structure ModelFactory looks for so it
#   does not return None when accessed.
